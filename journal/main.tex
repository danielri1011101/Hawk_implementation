\section{January 14 -- ?}
I was about to learn (in bird's eye view) the working of the \texttt{verify}
subroutine.

However, I started reviewing the norms and inner products.

\textbf{Question.} Are inner products closed under scalar multiplication? Yes,
if and only if the scalar is positive.

\section{NTRUsolve}
The NTRU equation is
\[
	fG - gF = q \mod X^n + 1
\]
where $f$ and $g$ are given, and the idea is to solve for $F$ and $G$. All the
polynomials in the equation are in
\(
	\mathbb{Z}[X]/\encl{X^n + 1}.
\)
