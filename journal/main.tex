\section{January 14 -- ?}
I was about to learn (in bird's eye view) the working of the \texttt{verify}
subroutine.

However, I started reviewing the norms and inner products.

\textbf{Question.} Are inner products closed under scalar multiplication? Yes,
if and only if the scalar is positive.

\section{NTRUsolve}
The NTRU equation is
\[
	fG - gF = q \mod X^n + 1
\]
where $f$ and $g$ are given, and the idea is to solve for $F$ and $G$. All the
polynomials in the equation are in
\(
	\mathbb{Z}[X]/\encl{X^n + 1}.
\)

\subsection{Resultants} The resultant of two polynomials $f$ and $g$ is zero if and
only if they have a common root. Thus one way to define it is
\[
	\mathrm{Res}(f,g)= g_n^m\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}f(\gamma_i)
\]
where the $\gamma_i$ are the roots of $g$ and $m$ is the degree of $f$.

Given a monic polynomial
\(
	\phi \in \mathbb{C}[X]
\)
of degree $n$ and a polynomial
\(
	f \in \mathbb{C}[X]/\encl{\phi}
\)
we denote by $\rema{f}{g}$ the matrix whose $j-$th row consists of the
coefficients of
\(
	x^{j-1}f \mod \phi,
\)
as in
\[
	\rema{f}{g} =
	\left[
		\begin{array}{c}
			f \mod \phi\\
			Xf \mod \phi\\
			\vdots\\
			X^{n-1}f \mod \phi
		\end{array}
	\right]
\]
